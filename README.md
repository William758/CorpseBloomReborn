Corpsebloom now grants a percentage of maximum health as reserve.

Healing is stored into reserve and heals you over time.

Prevent healing multipliers from affecting healing twice while using Corpsebloom.

Rejuvenation Rack double healing can be re-enabled with config.

Configure when healing goes into reserve. (HealBeforeReserve) and (HealWhenReserveFull)

Reserve is used at a slower rate when fully healed.

Reserve usage rate being divided by stack count can be re-enabled with config.

Current reserve is shown as a purple bar on the HealthBar of the HUD and AllyCards.
