# CorpseBloomReborn

![demo](https://i.imgur.com/XrgGoKp.png)

CorpseBloom now gives a percentage of maximum health as Reserve.

Healing is stored into Reserve and heals you over time.

Any extra healing past full reserve goes directly into Health.

Reserve has a minimum and maximum usage rate, so keep healing to keep it filled up.

Current Reserve is shown as a purple bar on the health bar on the HUD.
